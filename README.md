**"arka_public_key"** is a testnet public key

There are two modes to choose from while using paymaster ([Check docs for more](https://etherspot.fyi/arka/intro))

1.) sponsor - used in this example (This works by having Arka pay for the transaction fee, you can add more options to it like validUntil / validAfter). (Typically a project will get their own paymaster api key, deposit into the address)


2.) erc20 - This works by having the gas fee paid with whatever token is specified.

To check run:

`npm i`

And then 

`npm start`
